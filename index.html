    <!-- 
      Here's an example of how we'd allow others to use the React Widget we made
      We would provide our customers with instructions. 
      For example:

      "Copy these 3 lines of code and replace SUBREDDIT_HERE with the subreddit of your liking"
        <div class="reddit_widget" data-subreddit="SUBREDDIT_HERE"></div>
        <link href="https://giologist.github.io/article-react-reddit-widget/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://giologist.github.io/article-react-reddit-widget/index.js"></script>
    
    -->

    <!--
    When using your widget, you want to give people the chance to resize it to their needs
    -->

    <!-- Here's an example of how others can set their own styling -->
    <div style="margin: 100px auto; max-width: 400px;">
      <div class="reddit_widget" data-subreddit="javascript"></div>
    </div>

    <!-- Or leave the constraints completely up to the react app -->
    <div class="reddit_widget" data-subreddit="reactjs"></div>

    <!-- Below are the JS and CSS files that people will include when using our widget -->
    <link href="https://giologist.github.io/article-react-reddit-widget/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://giologist.github.io/article-react-reddit-widget/index.js"></script>
  </body>
